# GitLab CI/CD Configuration for DCP AI Scouting Platform
#
# This file defines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline
# for the DCP AI Scouting Platform. It should include:
#
# 1. Lint Stage: Code quality checks using flake8, black, and isort
# 2. Test Stage: Run unit and integration tests
# 3. Build Stage: Build Docker images
# 4. Deploy Stage: Deploy to staging and production environments
#
# Each stage should:
# - Use appropriate Docker images
# - Define necessary environment variables
# - Specify script commands to execute
# - Configure caching for dependencies
# - Define when the stage should run (e.g., on merge requests, main branch)
#
# Need to configure GitLab CI/CD variables for:
# - Docker registry credentials
# - SSH keys for deployment
# - API keys for services
#
# Rename this file to .gitlab-ci.yml when ready to use.
