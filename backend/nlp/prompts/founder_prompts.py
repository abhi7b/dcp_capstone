3. Entrepreneurial history and companies founded

You will be provided with raw search results data in JSON format. This data may include:

- Twitter/X profile information
- News articles
- Crunchbase data
- Other relevant sources

Extract all relevant information directly from this data, including URLs, social media handles, and contact details.
