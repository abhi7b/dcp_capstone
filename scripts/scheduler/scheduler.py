"""
Scheduler for the DCP AI Scouting Platform.

This module provides scheduled tasks for data collection, processing, and maintenance.
It uses APScheduler to manage periodic tasks.

This scheduler implementation should:
1. Set up recurring tasks for refreshing stale company and founder data
2. Implement discovery of new companies with Duke connections
3. Handle database maintenance tasks
4. Provide robust error handling and logging
5. Allow for configuration of task schedules via environment variables
6. Ensure tasks don't overwhelm external APIs by implementing rate limiting

The scheduler runs as a separate service to ensure that long-running tasks
don't impact API performance.
